## OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this lab was to organize a csv (input) file obtained from spotify
in a linked list. In which, spotify's top streamed artists would be read, organized 
in alphabetical order and printed to an output text file. This lab builds on top of 
the past lab we had (lab #2) which had us organize a spotify csv file in an array list,
display the artists names and the number of times that they appeared in spotify's 'top 
streaming list in an output text file as well.
