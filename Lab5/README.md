## OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this lab was to read multiple csv (input) files obtained from 
spotify. With these files, we were expected to make a binary search tree and report
the song title in ascending order as well as getting the average streaming numbers.
I tried following and completing the outlines/templates provided by Dr.
Chuang, and based off from there.
