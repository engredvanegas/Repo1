## Inspiration & Credits
README template inspired and provided by [@flynerdpl] (https://www.flynerd.pl/)

<p>I obtained the automatic picture slideshow from 
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp <br>
<br> I incorporated w2schools template (code) into the about me section and also
tweaked it a bit in order for it to better accomodate what I had in mind for
my page. </p>
