<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="intro">Hi! My name is Engred. I am a student at Brooklyn College, and I am currently taking CISC 
3130. Now, a little more about me - I enjoy horror movies, cooking, baking, making soap, 
listening to music, spending time with my family & dog, and I am an all-time animal lover. 
I most definitely feel at best in nature, there's just something about the great outdoors that 
I LOVE! Favorite foods include seafood, sushi, pasta, and acai bowls. I must confess that I do 
get bored easily and so Iâ€™m constantly finding things to do. Well, that's about it folks. Thank 
you for taking the time of getting to know me a little more. &#128075;
